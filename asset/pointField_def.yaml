# List of msg/PointField
# Mandatory field is 'name'
# By default, optional fields are set as :
#
# count: 1
# offset: Not defined
# datatype: "sensor_msgs__msg__PointField__FLOAT32"
#
# IT IS NOT RECOMMANDED TO FORCE 'offset' FIELD AS IT WILL BE AUTOMATICLY INDEXED
# BY THE PYTHON GENERATOR OR AT RUNTIME (depending selected option)
#
# Example :
#  - name: "x"
#    count: 1
#    datatype: "sensor_msgs__msg__PointField__FLOAT32"
#
# is equivalent to :
#  - name: "x"
#
